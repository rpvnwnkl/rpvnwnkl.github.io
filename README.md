# Lab 4 (Your Portfolio)

## Each assignment and lab shall include a README file that describes the work. This description must:

1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

    I believe I've implemented all required aspects of this assignment: three html pages, a css file with 5 or more rules, and successful validations of the html and css by http://validator.w3.org/.

2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

    I haven't collaborated with anyone on this assignment.

3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

    I've spent at least ten hours on this assignment, which I think is a lot for what I was able actually accomplish. I'm including time spent researching different html and css properties while writing the files.

4. Be written in either text format (README.txt) or in Markdown (README.md). No other formats will be accepted. Please use all capital letters for README

    I've chosen Markdown.
